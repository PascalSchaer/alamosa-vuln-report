\# Alamosa Vulnerability Reconnaissance Project



This repository documents publicly discoverable cybersecurity vulnerabilities in Alamosa, Colorado — including those found in local universities, medical centers, ISPs, and businesses. All data is collected passively through legal, open-source methods to promote cybersecurity awareness and responsible disclosure.



\## Objectives



\- Raise awareness of exposed digital infrastructure in the San Luis Valley region  

\- Practice and demonstrate ethical OSINT techniques  

\- Build a portfolio showcasing real-world reconnaissance skills  

\- Notify affected entities when serious risks are discovered  



\## Tools \& Technologies



\- \*\*Shodan\*\* (web + API)  

\- \*\*Python\*\* (for alerting and automation scripts)  

\- \*\*Git/GitHub\*\* (for documentation and version control)  

\- \*\*PowerShell \& CLI\*\* (workflow and scripting)  

\- \*\*Kali Linux\*\* (passive analysis only — no exploitation)  

\- \*\*Markdown\*\* (for structured, readable reports)



\## Current Focus Areas



\- Unprotected login portals (e.g., PaperCut NG, Axis2)  

\- Default credentials and misconfigured services  

\- Deprecated software exposed to the internet  

\- Poor SSL/TLS certificate practices  

\- SIP/VoIP endpoints without authentication



\## Legal \& Ethical Conduct



All reconnaissance in this project is \*\*passive\*\* and \*\*legal\*\*, using only publicly accessible information. No unauthorized access, scanning, or exploitation has occurred. Any high-risk findings are considered for responsible disclosure to the affected organizations.
