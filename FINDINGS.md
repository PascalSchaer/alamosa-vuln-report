**Date Discovered:** August 4, 2025  
**IP Address:** 192.156.134.153  
**Domain:** adams.edu  
**Organization:** Adams State University

### Risks:
- Public exposure of an internal administrative service.
- Possible exploitation of **known CVEs** related to PaperCut NG (e.g., RCE and auth bypass vulnerabilities if unpatched).
- Could aid attackers in credential harvesting or lateral movement if breached.

### Evidence:
- **Title:** PaperCut NG Login for Adams State University
- **Cookie:** SESSIONID token observed
- **SSL Cert:** Issued by Let's Encrypt, valid until July 20, 2025

### Recommendations:
- Immediately restrict access to the PaperCut NG interface using access control (IP whitelisting or VPN).
- Ensure the PaperCut NG software is fully patched.
- Implement login rate-limiting and obfuscation if public access is required.
- Monitor and alert on any unauthorized access attempts.

### Notes:
This finding is based on public Shodan data and does not include any active probing or exploitation. Responsible disclosure steps will be followed if applicable.
