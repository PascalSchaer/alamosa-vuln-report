\## Summary



A publicly accessible SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) service was discovered running on UDP port 5060. This service responds to SIP OPTIONS and REGISTER requests with a `403 Forbidden` response, confirming it is active and processing SIP traffic. While this alone may not represent an immediate vulnerability, publicly exposed VoIP services are often targeted for enumeration, abuse, toll fraud, or denial-of-service attacks if not secured properly.

\*\*Port:\*\* 5060/UDP  

\*\*Service:\*\* SIP (VoIP Signaling)  

\*\*Response:\*\* SIP/2.0 403 Forbidden  

\*\*Detection Methods:\*\*  

&nbsp; - \[x] Shodan.io  

&nbsp; - \[x] Nmap with `--script=sip-methods` and service version detection  

&nbsp; - \[x] SIPVicious toolkit (`svmap`, `svwar`)

\## Recommendations



\- Restrict access to UDP port 5060 using firewall rules or ACLs

\- Ensure SIP authentication is enabled and properly enforced

\- Apply rate limiting and SIP-aware IDS/IPS filtering

\- Monitor for unauthorized SIP traffic and scanning activity

\- Disable or move SIP services if unused externally

\## Additional Notes



Tools from the SIPVicious toolkit (`svmap`, `svwar`) were used strictly for passive or blocked information gathering. No brute force, extension enumeration, or exploit attempts were performed.



All reconnaissance was conducted legally and ethically to raise awareness of exposed services in critical infrastructure.
